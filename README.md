# Computational physics
This repository contains all the code I have been working on since I was an undergraduate physics student. The purpose of this repository is to share with the community and leave a consolidation of physics simulations on different topics:

# Photonic Crystals.
![defect](https://github.com/EstebanM-98/University_codes/blob/main/Images/defect.png)


# Nonlinear optics.

- Supercontinuum simulation.

![pulse](https://github.com/EstebanM-98/University_codes/blob/main/Images/pulse_fiber.png)

- Simulation of pulses in laser cavities.

# Statistical physics.

- Bose-Einstein condensate.

- Shape effects on the thermodynamic properties of the systems.

![thermodynamic properties](https://github.com/EstebanM-98/University_codes/blob/main/Images/square_rotat.png)
  

The notebooks still do not have an orderly structure, but I hope to make them more accessible to the general public.
