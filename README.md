# Computational physics
This repository contains all the code I have been working on since I was an undergraduate physics student. The purpose of this repository is to share with the community and leave a consolidation of physics simulations on different topics:

# Photonic Crystals.

# Nonlinear optics.

- Supercontinuum simulation.

- Simulation of pulses in laser cavities.

# Statistical physics.

- Bose-Einstein condensate.
- Shape effects on the thermodynamic properties of the systems.

The notebooks still do not have an orderly structure, but I hope to make them more accessible to the general public.
