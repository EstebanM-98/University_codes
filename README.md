# Computational physics
This repository contains the codes I have been working on since I was an undergraduate physics student. The purpose of this repository is to share with the community and leave a consolidation of physics simulations on different topics:

# Photonic Crystals.
Computing dispersive relation in a photonic crystal with a defect

# Nonlinear optics.

- Supercontinuum simulation.
Solving numerically Ginzburg Landau equation and propagate through an optical fiber.
![pulse](https://github.com/EstebanM-98/University_codes/blob/main/Images/pulse_fiber.png)

- Simulation of pulses in laser cavities.
I am solving the Ginzburg Landau equation numerically and propagating through a cavity composed of an Erbium-doped fiber, graphene, and single-mode fiber.

# Statistical physics.

- Shape effects on the thermodynamic properties of the systems.
Dependence of thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas as a function of shape confinement.

The notebooks still do not have an orderly structure, but I hope to make them more accessible to the general public.
